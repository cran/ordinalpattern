\details{
The standard ordinal pattern coefficient is a non-parametric and robust measure of dependence between two time series. It is based on ordinal patterns, which are defined as sequences of ranks of \code{d} subsequent observations. This sequences of subseqent observations can either move one observation per time or a whole block of \code{d} observations. The former is preferred since it uses more information. If one chooses the later, one has to decide whether the first or the last observations are removed in case that the time series length is no multiple of \code{d}. With regard to equal values within a window of consecutive observations (ties), the argument \code{tiesmethod} determines the approach for computing the respective ordinal patterns. The ``\code{first}'' method is in favor of increasing patterns, whereas the default ``\code{random}'' puts the equal values in random order.

Beside the default standard ordinal pattern coefficient, which range from -1 to 1, one can also look at the positive and negative ordinal pattern coefficient, which roughly measures whether there are unusual many identical or opposite patterns in the time series.  

The plot function draws both time series and shows the six most frequent coinciding pattern with counts on the right. At the bottom, the location of these coinciding patterns is visualized.
